# React-Indecision-App

A simple application built with React Javascript library that allows the end user(s) to chose among different options in a randomised way.

App deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at https://towerbrother.github.io/indecision-app/

# Motivation

The app was developed as part of a ReactJS tutorial. The tutorial featured usage of React class components to manage state. I refactored the source code using Hooks to align it with modern best practices.

# Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and built using the following technologies:

- React (incl. Hooks)
- Javascript
- SASS

# Features

The app allows the users to input different options and, in a randomised way, select an option.

The app prompts the users with an error message in case the user tries to input an existing option or in case the user tries to input an empty string as an option.

I used react-modal npm library to show the user the selected option.

The App is fully responsive and it ensures a pleasant UX using mobile, tablet or desktop devices.

# Credits

The app is part of the udemy [The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/) course by Andrew Mead. The app was fully refactored using React Hooks to align it with modern best practices.
